Automated Essay Feedback and Improvement Suggestions
- An AI system evaluates essays, offering feedback and improvement tips. It enhances writing skills and self-learning. With Whisper, students vocalize essays for AI review, easing the writing process.

Project Notes:

- Please remember to keep your repo private when you create it from this template.
- Be sure to create your report in the **intro-gen-ai** organization. 
- The name of the repo should be the name of the project, or a shortened version of the name.
- Each section should be completed by the deadline indicated. You submit by making a commit of this README.md file. Except for minor edits, please do no change the Proposal, Goals, or Metrics sections after the submission deadline.
- General guidance on formatting writing in markdown files (like this README.md file) is at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.
- There is a [recording of the the class discussion on the use of this template](https://vanderbilt.zoom.us/rec/share/RjihScz0Ti7RId0KMj7GWBc8XueS571_JnFqDQwli0AuKLsgaau0j_RcphBjwYtV.HP10ROf2TwPUn6TA?startTime=1697553005000).
- You can sign up for a time to discuss your ideas for the project at https://calendly.com/jesse-spencer-smith. We'll also be discussing project in class on Tuesday after Fall Break.
- Remember that there is an AI Showcase on April 19 (with prizes for Best in Show), so you might want to consider completing your project by then.

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
- The traditional process of providing feedback on student writing is slow and often not individualized, hindering learning progress and engagement. The Automated Essay Feedback and Improvement Suggestions project proposes using generative AI and Whisper to offer immediate, personalized feedback, making writing more accessible and the educational experience more engaging. This innovation aims to transform educational practices by enhancing learning outcomes and reducing the workload on educators.
### Proposed Solution/Approach
- Our solution is a state-of-the-art AI system that analyzes student essays in real-time, offering instant feedback on grammar, style, and content. By integrating OpenAI's Whisper technology, the system also transcribes spoken essays, broadening accessibility for all students, including those who find traditional writing challenging. This approach not only enhances the writing process but also empowers educators by automating the feedback loop, allowing them to dedicate more time to teaching and less to manual grading.

Day 13-14: Refinement and Preparation for External Testing
- Implement improvements based on internal feedback.
- Plan for external testing, including identifying a small group of users (students and educators) and preparing materials and consent forms for participation.
  
## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1: Improve Writing Skills and Learning Outcomes
### Goal 2: Increase Accessibility and Inclusivity in Education
### Goal 3: Enhance Teaching Efficiency and Effectiveness

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1: Feedback Turnaround Time: The average time taken by the system to provide feedback on submitted essays.
A (Excellent): Less than 1 minute
B (Good): 1-2 minutes
C (Average): 2-5 minutes
D (Poor): More than 5 minutes

### Metric 2: User Satisfaction Rate: Percentage of users (students and educators) who report satisfaction with the system's feedback quality, usability, and overall impact on the learning experience.

A (Excellent): 90-100%
B (Good): 75-89%
C (Average): 60-74%
D (Poor): Below 60%

### Metric 3: Accuracy of Feedback: The accuracy of feedback provided by the system, measured by comparing a subset of AI-generated feedback against expert human evaluation.

A (Excellent): 95-100% accuracy
B (Good): 85-94% accuracy
C (Average): 75-84% accuracy
D (Poor): Below 75% accuracy
